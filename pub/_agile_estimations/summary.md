## Pluralsight course

Next images are a kind of summary of what was most important to me.
No doubt I need to review this again several times until memorize everything, but this concepts started to change my mind about what is an estimation: started to embrace aproximation concept, size for estimation, negotiation and concept of cone of uncertainty.
Thank you so much to UST-global as this course was patrocined by them.
